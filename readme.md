# Logic 
A single bit, for example, can represent the truth of a statement, this is what logic is all about. Learn about the fundamentals of logic from this video:

__Question 1.__ What is the negation of the statement:
>"If I have enough time, I will become an awesome programmer"
In logic the two possible states are called 'true' and 'false' and the operator that combines two statements into a compound statement is called 'connective'. There is one unary connective (the negation), and two binary connectives (and, or). It is important to stress that the word 'binary' refers to the number of statements that are combined. A binary connective combines TWO statements, hence it is called BINARY. The negation connective, in contrast, is just dealing with ONE statement, hence it is called UNARY. (so, the 'binary' in 'binary connective' and the binary in 'binary digit' mean different things!)
